## LatticeFFTs.jl
Fourier transforms on lattices. Note that this approach uses standard FFTs instead of other approaches such as NFTs. 

# Usage
This package is designed to work with my other packages such as lattices from SpinFRGLattices.jl. It should however not be neccessary to use them. 
Documentation for usage will follow soon. For now, example usage can be found in the Examples folder or in `test/runtests.jl`
